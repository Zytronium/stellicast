# Stellicast
The YouTube alternative we're still waiting for.

Stellicast is a WIP video streaming platform that cares about your privacy,
doesn't track you, doesn't bombard you with ads, listens to community feedback,
and aims to provide the features everyone wants that YouTube won't give us.

With no official goal for a beta launch, Stellicast currently has no development
team besides a single developer, though we, or rather I, plane to put together a
team in 2026. We make no gaurantees about the future of Stellicast. It will either
be a huge success or a huge failure, most likely the latter, but someone has to
try.

I'm aware there are other YouTube alternatives out there, but I haven't seen any
that provide what I'm looking for in a YouTube alternative. Stellicast is my
attempt to create something that can actually compete with YouTube and provide
users with a non-google alternative. Stellicast plans to use zero third-party
services that involve Google or anything they stand for (i.e. tracking and
collecting personal data, using AI moderation without human review, etc.) While
unfortunately laws in some areas may require us to use certain controversial
features such as age verification, Stellicast will do its best to provide
privacy-focused features and avoid any such controversial solutions if possible.

Stellicast is currently in early development and is not ready for use. As of the
writing of this, it is not in a usable state. You cannot create accounts, upload
videos, like videos, comment on videos, etc. However, these features will all
be implemented in the future if this project continues to grow and develop.

This project currently has a budget of zero, and the only motivation that keeps
development going is the slow deterioration of YouTube and its userbase getting
more and more annoyed with YouTube. In the future, we will be accepting 
donations to help fund and motivate development. As this is currently a solo
project and I personally don't have any experience properly reviewing pull requests
(I'm a little paranoid about security threats), contributions will likely not be 
considered. 

## Project Plan Summary

**UI/**: Dark, modern, and fully customizable UI. Several different layouts and themes will be available, including one that emulates YouTube, all for free. The default theme will be dark space blue.

**AI Policy**: All content that contains any AI-generated content **must** disclose what is AI-generated, and depending on what is AI generated and how much of the content is AI, may have an "AI" label on the video card. AI for moderation will be used strictly to assist moderation and will never be used as a final decision for moderation. Mainly, it will be used to flag potential rule-breaking content such as NSFW content. By default, content with AI will be less promoted than fully human-made content. Content that is found to use AI when it was not disclosed will be moderated. Content that contains enough AI content will receive a smaller share of profit, to discourage the usage of AI on the platform.

**Moderation**: As mentioned above, AI may be used to assist moderation, but will never be used as a final decision. Apeals will be easy with a fair copyright claim process that does not have any effect until the claim has been accepted and a fair amount of time has passed for an appeal to have been made.

**Ads**: Maximum of 1 ad per 30 minutes of video, all skippable, no ads on videos shorter than 2 minutes or non-monetized videos. Ads will be strictly reviewed by humans before being accepted and publicly visible. No exceptions to rules.

**Child Safety**: Age-based filtering without using invasive AI verification, biometric data, or any other invasive technique unless required by law.

**Migration Tools**: (Stretch Goal, may not be possible and legal) Easy import of YouTube data (including videos, channels, account information, subscriptions to channels who have also imported, etc.)

**Revenue Model**: Free tier with ads and a paid premium tier with no ads, faster uploads, HD downloads, larger file size limit, and more.

**Separation of Personal vs Corporate Channels**: Channels must declare if they are personal or commercial. The algorithm favors personal channels by default, though the user can change this preference.

This separation of personal and corporate channels is the main feature of 
Stellicast. The "You" has been taken out of "YouTube" and we want to put it back.
Personal and corporate channels will be separated and will work differently, as 
well as personal channels being promoted more. Personal channels will be called 
Creators and corporate channels will be called Studios (These names are subject 
to change).  
Some examples of this would be:
- Mr Beast from 2015: **Creator**
- Mr Beast today: **Studio**
- Deep Humor: **Creator**
- Minecraft: **Studio**
- You with your paid team of 1 camera man and 1 editor working from home: **Creator**
- A large, organized team of 25 people who get paid to work on different aspects of each video: **Studio**
- A large team where most of the people focus on what's being filmed rather than video production and monetization: **Creator**

Ultimately, a Creator can choose to become a Studio for the extra perks (and 
less promotion) if they meet certain requirements (not yet decided, but most 
likely will at least include minimum channel performance statistics to be met).
If a channel's performance is high enough, they may be required to submit info
about their production team, and depending on their team, may be required to
become a Studio. For example, a Creator who has a team of 100 people focused on
monetization, legal work, and video production will definately be required to
become a Studio. However, a Creator making thousands of dollars but only has 
a team of 3 people is not required to become a Studio.

The primary definition of a Studio is a channel with a team of people and a
primary focus on monetization and video production.  
The primary definition of a Creator is a personal channel with a focus on 
broadcasting themself and/or their work rather than earning profit, though
that doesn't exclude Creators who also aim to monetize their work.

**Main Challenges**:
- Infrastructure costs and scaling
- Privacy-invasive laws
- Standing out against other YouTube alternatives and being a notable competitor with YouTube
- Building a proper moderation team
- Building a proper development team that can accept a variable wage in the start
- Marketing Stellicast
- Providing certain features as well as YouTube without compromising on quality and revenue
- Building a community around Stellicast
- Staying motivated to continue development without funding and avoiding burnout
- Putting privacy-focused ads on Stellicast
