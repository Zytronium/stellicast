[![Roadmap](https://img.shields.io/badge/roadmap-view-green)](https://stellicast-roadmap.vercel.app/)

Stellicast is a privacy-first video streaming platform built on the principles 
YouTube has abandoned: respecting your privacy, listening to the community, and 
putting creators before corporations.

## What Makes Stellicast Different

- **Privacy-First**: No tracking, no data harvesting, no Google integration
- **Ad-Conscious**: Maximum 1 ad per 30 minutes, all skippable, no ads on short or non-monetized videos
- **Creator-Focused**: Algorithm favors personal creators over corporate studios
- **Transparent Moderation**: Human-reviewed decisions with a fair appeal process
- **AI Transparency**: Mandatory disclosure of AI-generated content
- **Community-Driven**: Built on feedback, not shareholder demands

# Project Status

**Current Phase**: Early Development (Pre-Alpha)

Stellicast is currently in active development by a solo developer with plans to 
build a team in 2026. The platform is not yet full functional; there are no ads, 
playlists, or even report systems. However, these features are on the roadmap.

**Honesty Check**: This is an ambitious project with significant challenges 
ahead. While I'm committed to making it succeed, there are no guarantees. 
However, someone has to try, and existing alternatives don't deliver what I 
envision for a true YouTube competitor.

## Core Vision

### The Creator vs. Studio Philosophy

The "You" has been taken out of "YouTube" and we're putting it back. Stellicast 
distinguishes between **Creators** (personal channels) and **Studios** 
(commercial operations), with the algorithm favoring personal content by default.
Viewers can change this preference at any time.

#### What Defines Each?

**Creators**
- Personal channels focused on broadcasting themselves or their work
- Small teams (typically 0–5 people) with minimal production infrastructure
- Passion-driven content, though monetization is welcome
- Examples: Early Mr. Beast, Deep Humor, solo creators with a cameraman and editor

**Studios**
- Organized commercial operations with large production teams
- Primary focus on monetization and professional video production
- Large teams (25+ people) dedicated to different production aspects
- Examples: Modern Mr. Beast, official brand channels like Minecraft, large video production teams

Channels can voluntarily upgrade to Studio status once they meet performance 
requirements. High-performing channels with large production-focused teams may 
be required to transition to Studio status.

## Planned Features

### User Experience
- **Dark, Modern, Customizable UI**: Sleek by default and fully customizable with multiple layouts and themes
- **Fewer Ads**: No more than 1 ad per 30 minutes of video; no ads on videos shorter than one minute.
- **Fully Accessible**: Follows WCAG guidelines for accessibility

### Content & Moderation
- **AI Moderation Policy**: AI may assist, but humans always have the final say in moderation decisions
- **Content Labeling**: AI-generated content must be disclosed and will be appropriately labeled
- **Fair Copyright System**: Claims don't take effect until reviewed, with adequate appeal time unless required by law
- **Age-Based Filtering**: Safe content filtering without invasive age verification methods

### Monetization & Business Model
- **Free Tier**: Ad-supported access to all content
- **Premium Tier**: Ad-free experience with bonus features:
    - Faster upload speeds
    - HD video downloads
    - Larger upload file size limits
    - Additional perks TBD
- **Creator Revenue**: AI-heavy content receives reduced profit share to incentivize human creativity
- **Studio Revenue**: Studios receive higher profit share to offset reduced algorithmic promotion
- **Ad Standards**: Human-reviewed ads only, strictly enforced guidelines

### Migration (Stretch Goal)
- Import YouTube data including videos, channels, and subscriptions
- *(Subject to legal and technical feasibility)*

## Current Challenges

Building a YouTube competitor requires overcoming significant obstacles:

- Infrastructure costs and scaling to handle video hosting
- Navigating privacy-invasive regulations in various jurisdictions
- Standing out against other YouTube alternatives
- Building experienced moderation and development teams
- Marketing on a low budget
- Implementing privacy-respecting advertising with reasonable profit
- Maintaining development momentum and avoiding burnout
- Building a sustainable community from the ground up

## Contributing

Currently, this is a solo project. Due to security concerns and my limited 
experience with pull request reviews, external contributions aren't being 
accepted at this time. However, I encourage you to share your thoughts (and bug
reports) by posting issues, and as the team grows, we'll establish proper
contribution guidelines and start accepting pull requests. In the meantime,
I encourage you to spread the word to help build awareness so Stellicast can
grow.

## Funding

**Current Budget**: \$100  
**Money Spent**: \$21.25  
**Money Donated**: \$0  
**Profit Earned**: \$0  

Development is fueled by frustration with YouTube's direction and the belief 
that users deserve better. Any donations will greatly help improve motivation
and improve infrastructure.
