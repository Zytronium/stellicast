# Stellicast Privacy Policy

_<small>Last updated: December 25, 2025</small>_

Stellicast ("we", "us", "our") is a work-in-progress video streaming platform. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our website and related services (collectively, the "Service").

Because Stellicast is in early development and not yet in a full production state, the scope of data actually collected at any given time may be smaller than what is described below. However, this document describes the types of data we **may** collect as features are implemented.

**Note:** _This Privacy Policy is provided for informational purposes only and is not legal advice._

---

## 1. Who We Are

Stellicast is an independent project aimed at building a privacy-focused alternative to mainstream video platforms.

If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact the project owner at:

- **Contact:** stellicast@zytronium.dev  

---

## 2. Scope of This Policy

This Privacy Policy applies to:

- The Stellicast website and web application.
- Any related pages such as account, upload, watch, and embedded player pages.
- Any communication channels we explicitly link to this policy.

It does **not** apply to:

- Third-party websites or services that we link to.
- Third-party services you interact with independently of Stellicast.

Those services have their own privacy policies.

## 3. Information We May Collect

### 3.1. Information You Provide Directly

Depending on which features are enabled and used, we may collect:

- **Account Information**
    - Email address
    - Username or display name
    - Password (stored only as a secure hash through our authentication provider)
    - Profile information you choose to add (e.g., bio, avatar, links)

    - Information you provide when you contact us (e.g., email address, message content)
    - Suggestions, feedback, or bug reports you submit

You are not required to provide personal data that is not strictly necessary for the functioning of the Service, but certain features (such as account creation or uploading videos) will not work without some information.

---

### 3.2. Information Collected Automatically

When you access or use the Service, certain information may be collected automatically. This can include:

- **Usage Data**
    - Pages and screens you visit
    - Features you interact with (e.g., watch page, upload page)
    - Timestamps and duration of your sessions

- **Device & Technical Data**
    - IP address
    - Browser type and version
    - Operating system and device type
    - Basic diagnostic information (e.g., error logs, performance metrics)

We use this information primarily to:

- Operate and maintain the Service
- Prevent abuse and secure the platform
- Debug issues and improve performance

We do **not** currently use invasive tracking or behavioral advertising technologies such as cross-site tracking beacons, third-party advertising pixels, or similar tools. If that changes in the future, this policy will be updated.

---

### 3.3. Cookies and Local Storage

We may use cookies, local storage, or similar technologies to:

- Keep you logged in
- Store basic preferences (e.g., layout or theme, when that feature is implemented)
- Provide essential security protections (e.g., CSRF tokens, session cookies)

We aim to minimize the use of non-essential cookies. If and when we introduce optional cookies (e.g., analytics), we will provide a clear explanation and, where required, obtain your consent.

---

## 4. Third-Party Services

Stellicast uses certain third-party services to operate. These services may process some of your data in accordance with their own privacy policies.

### 4.1. Authentication & Database (Supabase)

We use **Supabase** as our database platform and authentication provider. Supabase may process:

- Your email address and password (passwords stored as secure hashes)
- Authentication tokens and session data
- Basic metadata related to your account and actions within Stellicast (i.e., liked videos, video titles, comments, etc.)

Supabase acts as our data processor for these purposes. For more details about their data practices, please review Supabase's own privacy policy.

---

### 4.2. Content Delivery & Media (Bunny.net)

We use **Bunny.net** as part of our infrastructure (e.g., for content delivery / video storage). When you access media or other content delivered via Bunny.net, they may collect and temporarily store certain technical information, which typically can include:

- Your IP address
- Browser and device information
- Requested resources (such as images, videos, or static files)
- Timestamps and basic request/response data

**Note:** We are not Bunny.net and we do not control their internal data collection practices. The exact data they collect and how they use it is governed by Bunny.net's own privacy policy and terms, which you should review directly on their website.

We use Bunny.net primarily to:

- Upload, store, and stream video content
- Store and deliver video thumbnails
- Process and transcode video content
- Improve performance and reliability of the Service
- Reduce latency for users in different geographic regions

We do not instruct Bunny.net to use data from our traffic for advertising, independent profiling, or AI training.

### 4.3. Hosting & Infrastructure

We currently use **Vercel** to host Stellicast. Vercel may process:

- Server logs, including IP addresses and request details
- Error logs and performance metrics

They process this data to support secure and reliable operation of the Service and provide logs to us for security and troubleshooting purposes. We configure our providers with privacy in mind and avoid unnecessary logging where possible.

---

    - Enable upload, streaming, and playback of videos

2. **To improve and develop the Service**
    - Debug technical issues
    - Analyze usage patterns at an aggregated level
    - Refine UI/UX, performance, and stability

## 6. Legal Bases for Processing (If You Are in the EEA/UK)

(Once implemented) If you are in the European Economic Area (EEA), the United Kingdom (UK), or a region with similar requirements, we process your personal data based on:

- **Contract**: To provide the Service you request (e.g., account creation, video hosting/streaming).
- **Legitimate Interests**: To improve the Service, ensure security, prevent abuse, and maintain reliable infrastructure.
- **Legal Obligations**: To comply with applicable laws, court orders, and regulatory requirements.
- **Consent**: For any optional or non-essential processing where consent is required by law.

You can withdraw your consent at any time where consent is the legal basis.

---

## 7. Data Retention

We retain your information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this policy, including:

- **Account data:** kept while your account is active. If you delete your account, we will delete or anonymize data where feasible, subject to retention requirements (e.g., for security, fraud prevention, or legal obligations).
- **Content data:** videos, comments, and related content may be retained while your account or channel exists, or as long as necessary to enforce our policies.
- **Logs and technical data:** kept for a limited period sufficient to ensure security, debug issues, and maintain service reliability, then deleted or anonymized.

Retention periods may change as the platform evolves and as legal obligations or best practices require.

---

## 8. Data Sharing

We may share your information in the following circumstances:

1. **Service Providers and Processors**
    - With third-party vendors that help us operate the Service (e.g., hosting, database, authentication, content delivery). These providers process data only according to our instructions and subject to appropriate safeguards.

2. **Legal and Safety**
    - When required by law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request.
    - To protect the safety, rights, or property of Stellicast, our users, or the public.

3. **Business Changes**
    - In connection with a merger, acquisition, or other structural change of the project, subject to applicable data protection requirements.

We do not sell your personal information.

---

## 9. International Data Transfers

Depending on where you are located and where our infrastructure and service providers are based, your data may be transferred to and processed in countries that may not have the same level of data protection as your home country.

Where required by law, we will take appropriate measures to ensure that such transfers comply with applicable data protection regulations (for example, by using standard contractual clauses where relevant).

---

## 10. Your Rights and Choices

Your rights will depend on your jurisdiction, but may include:

- **Access:** Request a copy of the personal data we hold about you.
- **Correction:** Request correction of inaccurate or incomplete data.
- **Deletion:** Request deletion of your personal data, subject to certain exceptions.
- **Restriction:** Request restriction of processing in certain circumstances.
- **Objection:** Object to certain types of processing, including profiling based on legitimate interests.
- **Portability:** Request a copy of your data in a commonly used, machine-readable format where technically feasible.

To exercise any of these rights, please contact us at stellicast@zytronium.dev. We may need to verify your identity before responding.

If you are in the EEA/UK or a similar jurisdiction, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority.

---

## 11. Children's Privacy

Stellicast is not currently intended for use by children under the age at which they can provide consent to data processing in their jurisdiction (often 13 or 16, depending on the country).

We do not knowingly collect personal data from children below that age. If you believe that we have unintentionally collected data from a child, please contact us so we can take appropriate action, such as deleting the data or securing consent from a parent or guardian.

No privacy-invasive or AI-based age verification is currently in place. In fact, we do not yet have any method of age verification implemented at this time, though we will in the future.

As the platform matures and child-safety features are implemented, this section will be updated accordingly.

---

## 12. Security

We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your data, including but not limited to:

- Using established providers for authentication and storage
- Using encryption in transit (HTTPS) wherever possible

However, no online service can guarantee absolute security. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for using unique, strong passwords.

---

## 13. Early-Stage Status and Future Changes

Stellicast is in **early development** and not yet a finished product. As we add features such as comments, follows, notifications, and extended analytics, our data handling may change.

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do:

- We will update the "Last updated" date at the top of this page.
- For significant changes, we may provide additional notice (e.g., a banner on the site or an email, if appropriate).

Your continued use of the Service after changes take effect will constitute acceptance of the updated policy.
